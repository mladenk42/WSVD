Compiling the ARPACK from source to a windows dll is most easily done using MinGW on Linux.
The C++ code can be compiled in Visual Studio, but requires ARPACK C++ header files and some additional linker setting modifications.

I plan to post a full tutorial from my notes on this some day along with the accompanying VS solution. But for now, if you really need to recompile this from source, feel free to contact me at mladen.karan@fer.hr and I'll try to help as best as I can.
